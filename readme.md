# List of Routes

```sh
# Api Routes:

+--------+-------------------------+
  Method | URI
+--------+-------------------------+
  GET    | /movies
  POST   | /movies/add
+--------+-------------------------+

```

# Comments and Assumptions

1. Route GET /movies accept optional query string

- duration
- an array of genres
  e.g. /movies?duration=100&genres=comedy%2Cfantasy%2Ccrime

a. ANY GENRE PROVIDED IN A QUERY STRING THAT DON'T MATCH ACCEPTABLE GENRES IS DELETED FROM THE LIST
e.g., ["Comedy", "fantasy", "Romantic"] => ["Comedy", "Fantasy"]

b. In the task specification, it is said that the endpoint should also return movies with genres saved in lower case. This is not part of my implementation as it's only possible to add movie with "only predefined ones from db file". The assumption is that movie can be created if and only if all genres can be found in predefined values (case sensitie).
